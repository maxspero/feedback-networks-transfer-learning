# feedback-networks-transfer-learning
Several transfer learning experiments on the implementation of Feedback Networks (Zamir et al., 2017). This repo has been forked and cleaned up by these experiments and leaving only the model itself. That fork can be found [here](https://github.com/maxspero/feedback-networks-pytorch).
